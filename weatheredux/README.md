Simple React + Redux weather app using third party weather API

### Setup
If you do not have an API key, one can be created in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).  Create API_KEY.js in the root directory and export your YouTube Books API key.

export const API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
```
